# hello-world
I'm fascinated by video games and mods created by communities and fans. Now I just need to learn how I can contribute to those communities.
I have a little experience with each; C+, html, Unity, Android studio, Python, and Solarus.

Fast Forward and now I'm obsessed with proceudral generation and how to make it fun to learn within a game similar to "DAGGERFALL" minus baggage.

I'm curious what y'all think about Marvellous Inc.
